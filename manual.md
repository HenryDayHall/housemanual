# Dear House-sitter

Thank you to agreeing to look after out lovely cat.
We hope she behaves herself.

## Section 1; Emergencies

### Electric issues
The fuse box is in the hall by the door.

### Water flood
The mains valve is under the sink in the toilet.
(Toilet, not the bathroom.)

### No internet

It just goes down sometimes, sorry. 
You probably just have to wait, it will likely be back in
~3 hours. 

You are welcome to reset it a few times while you wait,
to reset the internet;
1. Find the router in the walking cupboard on the cloth shelves
2. Remove the power cord.
3. Count to 10.
4. Replace the power cord.

It won't help, the problem is with the line not the router,
but it might entertain you.


### Locked out

Firstly, the key to the flat itself is tricky. 
You need to push gently on the left hand door while turning anticlockwise,
or it won't do the last little bit of turn.

The letting agents number is +420602392784 but probably try contacting us first,
because it will be easier for us to convince the letting agent to let you in.


### Vet

The cat carrier is in the walk in cupboard in the hall.
There is a box-carrier, and a mesh backpack.
Put her in whichever.

Vet's address;
    Jana Masaryka 457/1
    12000,
    Praha 2-Vinohrady

Website is [vetvin.cz](vetvin.cz).

In an emergency, you can just walk in with the cat.
The vet speaks English.
We will of course repay you for any emergency treatment needed.

## Section 2; Cat Care

Marmie (short for Marmalade) is lovely, and mostly low maintenance.


### Windows

She cannot reach to upper windows, so they can be open at any time.
The lower windows cannot be opened unless she is shut out of the room
while they are open.
She is quite interested in climbing out, and many cats
do not have a good sense of hight.

### Food

She has a bit of a sensitive stomach, so please feed her nothing but
her sensitive, expensive, cat food. There is loads of it.


We feed her 50g in the evening.
In the K6 cupboard in the kitchen you will find
- A white plastic, grey lid, "cereal box" style container, containing dry cat food.
- A small empty margarine tub.
- A black electric food scale.

These are for cat feeding.
She can also have the brand of cat treats found in this cupboard.

At the same time as her meal, she would normally be given HALF an anti-acid tablet.
These are in a box labelled "FAMOSAN" in the same cupboard.
There is also a pill splitter in the cupboard; it's white, plastic and hinged,
about the size of a lighter.
The pills must be split in half, she can only have half at a time.

Actually feeding the half anti-acid to the cat is tricky.
She tries to spit it out.
Ideally, you put it in her mouth, gently hold up her chin,
and wait a bit for her to swallow.
If it isn't going well, (and you realise you need all you fingers),
it's fine to skip this.
She may throw up more frequent hairballs, but it isn't a major issue.

### Vomit

Talking of throwing up, Marmie does produce frequent hairballs, sorry.

The sofas should both be covered in easy to remove, washable sheets.
Underneath these sheets, the padded blanket (comforter) is not machine washable,
they can only be wiped down.

The rugs in the hall can be machine washed, on wool-wash settings (cold, low spin).

Otherwise, there are rags, in a box labelled "rags", and a bucket in the walk in cupboard in the hall for cleaning.

It's best if she cannot get into the bedroom during the day, 
to keep the bed clear for hairballs.
Also, the porcelain cups on the shelf in there are old.


### Grooming

In theory, she produces less hairballs if she is regularly brushed.
She doesn't like being brushed, it's best not to hold her still,
just let her wander and follow her with the brush.
It's not a necessity, but it may be helpful.

### Screaming at the door

She would like to be walked. 
In the evening, she can be treated to this.
Around sundown is best.

If you are willing, then there is a cat harness in H1, on the wall in the hall.
Once you have that on, you can see how far she feels like leading you.
She is allowed to go up and down the stairs, and into the back garden,
the key for which is labelled Praha Dver.
She is not allowed out of the front door of the building.
Don't forget to take a flat key with you.

No worries if you don't feel like doing that, it's just a treat.


### Night-time screaming at the door

She would like to be walked again, sorry.
There is a procedure to get quiet (hopefully);

- Shutting the door to the hall will make her realise you are not listening.
- She will stop meowing when she thinks you're not listening.
- She will get lonely in the hall and start scratching and meowing at your door.
- If you let her in, she will come sleep with you.

This mostly works, sometimes she wakes up again later and the meowing restarts.
Feel free to just shut her in the hall if you prefer.

### Plants

She will eat any non-succulent plants she has access to.
Due to this lack of self control, we cannot have any flowers in the house as some are toxic to cats.
She also needs to be excluded from the bathroom, as she will eat the fern if she gets in.

### Playing

Marmie will be very grateful if you spend a little time playing with her.
To this end, she has a collection of sticks with string-toys.

## Section 3; Where to find it

### Food

You can find most food in the upper part of K6,
also in the fridge and freezer of course.
There is wine and beer on the rack beneath K1.

Please help yourself to whatever you like.

When closing cupboard K3, with the rotating glass shelves,
please ensure that the rotating shelves have been turned so that the flat bit is closest to you before shutting the door.
Otherwise the door will not shut properly and this will put pressure on the glass.
It's a silly design.

### Cleaning

Most cleaning materials and a dustpan and brush are under the kitchen sink.
Laundry liquid is also there.
Rags for cleaning are in a box in the hallway cupboard (H2),
some of them are pretending to be socks, but actually they are
cleaning rags.

The hoover is the in hallway cupboard in crate H1 near the door.

### Bed linen and towels

Bed linen and towels are under the bed in cloth bags.
You can also find a spare duvet under the bed in a cardboard box.
Extra blankets can be found in the chest marked B1.


### Wifi password

It's on the wifi router, it's the one called WLAN network key.
The one labelled password if for changing settings of the router (please don't do that....).

### Key to bins/garden

On hooks in the hall by the door.

### Cat equipment

A cat carrier can be found in the hallway cupboard.
There is both a backpack (cat prefers this) and a box.

The cat's brush is in the kitchen on the side near the door.
In the hallway cupboard there is extra food, it's in a crate near the back on the right.
Cat toys just live all over the house.
The cat litter + litter scoop live in the toilet on the black shelves.


## Section 4; Household notes

### Noise

Blocks of flats in Prague are governed by some noise regulations.
Most of them won't be relevant, but please don't run the washing machine after 8pm.



### Rubbish and Recycling

There are a set of grey plastic bins near the kitchen door for rubbish and recycling.
Coloured dots on the lids indicate what they are for.

- The large one with the black dot is rubbish, including food waste.
- The large one with the blue dot is paper and cardboard recycling.
- The very small one with the green dot is tetrapack recycling.
- The medium one with the yellow dot and holes is plastic recycling, including film.
- The medium one with the red dot is metal recycling.
- The medium one with the green dot is glass recycling.

Hopefully you won't need to take any of them out.
If you need to take rubbish out, that goes in the bins by the street door of the flat.
These are locked, and there is a key for the bins in the hallway on the hooks by the door,
it has an orange tag.
Recycling bins are around the city in different locations, the closest to us are by the river
to the south.
